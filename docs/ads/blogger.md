AFH Permit Automation: Get Permit-Ready Floor Plans and Checklists Without an Architect

---

## Body (copy-paste for Blogger)

**Intro**  
If you’re converting a single-family home into an Adult Family Home (AFH) in Washington State, you know the permit process can be heavy: floor plans, WAC/IRC compliance, and local building inspector checklists. What if you could do most of it yourself—without hiring an architect?

**What it does**  
AFH Permit Automation is a web app that lets you:

- **Enter your property and floor plan** — Address, city, ZIP, total sq ft, and every room (bedrooms, bathrooms, living, kitchen) with dimensions.
- **Meet WAC/IRC/WABO** — Bedroom size (70 sq ft), egress windows (5.7 sq ft), 32" doors, grab bars, ramp, smoke/CO alarms, fire extinguisher. The app checks your plan against what local building inspectors expect.
- **Get a permit-ready text floor plan** — Copy it for your application or feed it into tools (e.g. isometric/3D, then proposal PDF) using the workflow: floorplan → isometric → mixboard → notebooklm.
- **Use permit forms and a real case study** — City of Centralia, Lewis County, WABO AFH Initial Inspection Checklist, plus a full example: 2606 Cooks Hill Rd, Centralia—current vs future floor plans and submission package.
- **Train as a consultant** — 8-week curriculum and Top 100 AFH admin questions (WAC/IRC, with answers). Plus Moltbot/Clawdbot scripts to automate paperwork.

**Who it’s for**  
AFH operators, consultants, and advisors in Washington—Centralia, Lewis County, Chehalis, Lacey, Tumwater, Olympia—who want to prepare permits DIY and reduce reliance on third-party architects.
