Hi [Name],

Are you converting a home into an Adult Family Home (AFH) in Washington—or advising someone who is?

We built **AFH Permit Automation** so you can:

- Enter property and room dimensions once
- Get a permit-ready text floor plan and WAC/IRC/WABO compliance checklist
- Use permit forms and a full case study (2606 Cooks Hill Rd, Centralia)
- Train with an 8-week consultant curriculum and Top 100 AFH questions
- Automate paperwork with Moltbot/Clawdbot scripts

No architect required for the core floor plan and checklist. Works for Centralia, Lewis County, Chehalis, Lacey, Tumwater, Olympia.
