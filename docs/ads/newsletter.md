**Hi [First Name],**

Converting a single-family home into an Adult Family Home (AFH) in Washington? Permit paperwork—floor plans, WAC/IRC compliance, building inspector checklists—can be time-consuming and costly if you hire an architect for every step.

**AFH Permit Automation** helps you do it yourself:

- **Enter your property and rooms** — Address, floors, room types, dimensions (bedrooms, bathrooms, living, kitchen). Set egress type, grab bars, ramp, alarms, extinguisher.
- **Get a permit-ready floor plan** — Text/ASCII summary you can attach to applications or feed into 2D→3D tools (floorplan → isometric → mixboard → proposal PDF).
- **See compliance at a glance** — Bedroom size (70 sq ft), egress (5.7 sq ft), 32" doors, grab bars, ramp, alarms. Fix gaps before submission.
- **Use permit forms and a real case study** — City of Centralia, Lewis County, WABO checklist, plus 2606 Cooks Hill Rd (current vs future plan and submission package).
- **Train as a consultant** — 8-week curriculum and Top 100 AFH admin questions. Moltbot scripts to automate paperwork.

**Cities:** Centralia, Lewis County, Chehalis, Lacey, Tumwater, Olympia (and same workflow for other WA cities).
