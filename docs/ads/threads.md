## Post 2 (thread opener)

**Thread 1:**  
Washington AFH operators: Tired of permit paperwork and not sure if your floor plan meets WAC/IRC? We built a tool that does the heavy lifting.

**Thread 2:**  
You enter: address, rooms, dimensions, egress type, grab bars, alarms.  
You get: permit-ready text floor plan + compliance checklist (bedroom size, egress 5.7 sq ft, 32" doors, ramp, etc.).

**Thread 3:**  
Plus: full case study (2606 Cooks Hill Rd, Centralia), consultant curriculum, Top 100 AFH questions, and Moltbot scripts to automate paperwork.

**Thread 4:**
