**What is AFH Permit Automation?**  
A web app that helps Washington State Adult Family Home (AFH) operators and consultants prepare permit applications. You enter your property address and floor plan (rooms and dimensions); the app produces a permit-ready text floor plan and a WAC/IRC/WABO compliance checklist.

**Features**
- Floor plan entry: property, floors, rooms (bedrooms, bathrooms, living, kitchen) with dimensions, egress type, grab bars
- Compliance engine: bedroom size (70 sq ft), egress (5.7 sq ft), 32" doors, grab bars, ramp, alarms, fire extinguisher
- Permit forms: City of Centralia, Lewis County, WABO AFH Initial Inspection Preparation Checklist
- Case study: 2606 Cooks Hill Rd, Centralia—current vs future floor plans and submission package
- Consultant curriculum: 8-week training and Top 100 AFH admin questions
- Moltbot/Clawdbot: Top 10 scripts to automate AFH inspection paperwork

**Workflow**  
Floorplan → isometric → mixboard → notebooklm (e.g. Nano Banana/Gemini for 3D, then proposal PDF for the city).

**Who it’s for**  
AFH operators and consultants in Centralia, Lewis County, Chehalis, Lacey, Tumwater, Olympia, and other WA cities who want to prepare permits DIY.
